ATM simulation system built using Java Swing for the UI, JPA Hibernate for persistence, and a structured multi-layer architecture. Users can register, authenticate, and perform operations like deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and view mini statements. Each transaction updates the user's balance and logs details in a database. The ATMOperations handles business logic, while the UserService communicates with the DAO layer to perform CRUD operations. The mini statement feature fetches real-time transaction history and displays it with color-coded transactions. This system ensures data consistency via JPA transactions and provides an intuitive interface for users.
